Think of TC as measuring:

“How favorable is the average card in the shoe?”

But EV-per-$ also depends on:

“How many cards remain to undo that favorability before I bet them?”

A more precise view: “persistence time” of favorable counts

Define a favorable condition like:

TC≥TC min
	​

The natural question is:

starting from TC=2, what’s the probability TC stays ≥ 1 for the next N hands?

That probability depends heavily on dr because dr determines N (how many hands you’ll play before shuffle).

Deep penetration (small dr): N is small ⇒ high persistence probability

Shallow penetration (large dr): N is large ⇒ eventually the count will wander down with high probability

So the value of a given TC is higher when dr is low because you can actually exploit it during the remaining shoe.
